# Toy-Language-Interpreter
Welcome to the Java Toy Language Interpreter! This project aims to provide a simple yet extensible interpreter for a toy language written in Java. The interpreter supports the execution of programs written in the toy language, and it includes branches for different synchronization mechanisms for threads as well as procedures.
